# Word-Guess-Game

* This game was suppose to show the 2019 NBA All-Star Starters.

# Layout:

* Am Image was suppose to populate when a name was randomly generated under Who is this?
    * Got stuck on js functions and never made it back.

* When player name is guessed correctly, player name moves to the repository where they represent: West or East All Stars. There, their full name would be displayed. 
    * Again couldn't complete

# GamePlay

* Game is a version of hangman where players would guess the name of who the imaged individuals are with letters.

* Players have 10 guesses.

# Miscellaneous

* I need lots more practice to figure out Javascript functions etc...
